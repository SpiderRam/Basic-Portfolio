    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/sheep_profile.png" alt="Photo of me" class="profile_pic">
    <p>I am reinventing myself:  after many years of physically demanding
      outdoor work, I have decided to give my lower back a break.
      I am excited to learn how to code, and I look forward to a 
      new career, which will undoubtedly be challenging in other ways.</p>
    <p>I am a great big nerd-- I enjoy reading mainly Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and 
      I have an embarassingly large collection of geeky DVDs.  In addition, I 
      really enjoy playing tabletop games, such as Firefly, Terraforming Mars, 
      Pandemic, Battlestar Galactica, Last Night on Earth... the list goes on.  
      I like to keep my hands busy by working on counted cross-stitch projects, 
      and I spend a lot of my free time (and money) landscaping my yard.  I have 
      three cats, two dogs, and five chickens, and I used to own a flock of sheep, 
      which I very much enjoyed.</p>
    <p>I like to go for walks with my dogs at Pony Pasture and other parks around
      Richmond.  I love the river, and the natural beauty of the park in all seasons.  
      I geek out there, too, seeking out various plants to identify.  I use the 
      iNaturalist app to find those I don't know.  This often leads to interesting
      conversations with my customers and coworkers at Sneed's Nursery.</p>
